            <p></p>A civilian cargo vessel from the PRU, known as the "За Катаріне", or Za Katarine, sunk in the Intermarum Canal today. Investigators have told us that several Kellerian military ships were passing through the Canal at the time, and no other obstructions or ships were spotted in the canal. The ship was seen on fire briefly before a detonation occured below deck, resulting in the ship sinking. No members of the Za Katarine's crew have been recovered. Investigations ongoing.</p>

The Proletarian Republic awoke in mourning. Word had arrived to the country over the night that a civilian cargo ship, carrying nothing but grain, had been sunk seemingly without warning or reason while crossing the Intermarium Canal. Hundreds of sailors and tones of food were gone, in the span of mere hours. And those responsible for this attack? The papers pointed to the empire of Kalleria.
Even in the hours prior to the government's pronouncement, thousands of people across Urukand went to the streets in protest, demanding answers and retaliation. Cries for war and the toppeling of the Kallerian Monarchy echoed through the streets of Tasharkan, Zafra, Kashmir and all other cities of the Proletarian Republic.
Response from the government would come at exactly 13:00 as a speech by Premier Temujin Kahirov. Standing on a podium overlooking the Red Square, his words would be transmitted throughout the nation:</p>
            <p><i>"Comrades, I come to you today in mourning. Yesterday, December 23rd, at 20:32, operators of the Proletarian Merchant Navy lost contact with the cargo ship Za Katarina while the same ship was exiting the Intermarium Canal en route to our brothers in the Southernist Socialist Republic. Za Katarina carried nothing but 15,000 tonnes of Grain and 110 Sailors, all of which are currently missing. From what our intelligence has been able to discover of the situation, and according to the last reports of Za Katarina before loosing contact, the ship had just exited the western entrance of the Canal and was charting its course to the S.S.R before coming under fire from a then-unidentified vessel. Now, however, we know who launched this cowardly attack.
The Kallerian Empire has currently stationed a fleet, numbering between 50 and 80 ships, in the western end of the Intermarium Canal. In their arrogance, they thought they could cover this hostile deployment as a mere "training exercise", but now this fleet has shown its true colors. It was a ship from this fleet which fired upon Za Katarina, with no prior warning or motive other than blatantly sinking it. It is safe to assume, therefore, that the Kallerians have not only attacked our people without provocation, but have also placed a blockade on the Free Canal against our ships.
As I talk to you now, comrades of the Proletarian Republic, our embassy is attempting to contact the Kallerian government to achieve a peaceful solution to this endeavor. Our demands are simple: the removal of all Kallerian Vessels from the proximity of the Intermarium Canal, reparations for the sinking and a guarantee of non-agression against the Proletarian Republic. If they deny these simple terms, or fail to accept them by December 29th, we will recognize the Empire's attacks as an act of war against the hard-working people of our nation, and we shall respond in kind."</i></p>
